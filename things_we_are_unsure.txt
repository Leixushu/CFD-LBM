Value of constant ideal gas R
Implementation of weights in g_eq (same as f or not)
Where to put the gravity?
Initial conditions of g field(?)
Initial value of T is 0 and we used formula for g from paper2.pdf hence we init. T = 0
Is C_s constant? It is stated in the paper that it is equal to sqrt(RT)
