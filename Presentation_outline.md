PRESENTATION PLAN

1. Introduction - What are we going to talk about?
	- We did LBM driven cavity and heat transport in 3D
	- Aim of the presentaion is to compare NSE with LBM from different perspectives

2. Main Part
	2.1 Introduction to LBM - thoery (including stability etc. ) and comparison to NSE in summary. (Only theory here).
		2.1.1 Show application from industry (nice pictures Exa etc., where is NSE typicaly used vs LBM?)
	2.2. Results for Driven Cavity and comparison
		- methodology (1-slice, free slip)
		- max difference (point by point etc.)
		- runtime, memory parameters in a nice table. Run time graph for different mesh sizes.
	2.2. Results for Heat Transport and comparison
		- Heat transport theory
		- methodology (1-slice, free slip)
		- max difference (point by point etc.)
		- runtime, memory parameters in a nice table. Run time graph for different mesh sizes.

	2.3 Implementation - show main in pseudo code, talk about functions like doColiision, treatBoundary etc., mention flags (binary stuff).

3. Summary - most important things that we want people to remember, not too long. E.g. 


NOTES: look into questions in the worksheet.
